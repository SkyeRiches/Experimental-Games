# Experimental Games
As part of the experimental games module during second year of university, we got in teams and had to make a game that was experimental in some way, be it in gameplay or control scheme. 

For our experimental project we came up with the idea of turning the classic toy 'Bop It' into a controller for a game. 

We started off by getting our hands on a bop it and then taking the inner circuitry out and replacing it with a raspberry pi pico. The pico was then programmed using a short python script to emulate keyboard input when the buttons from the bop it are pressed. The casing of the bop it was then reattatched.

We then settled on the idea that we were gonna use the bop it to create a cooking game where each control on the bop it links to a function for cooking. 

# Functionality
The gameplay of the game is based around being a shoddy burger van, you use the controls on the bop it to prepare the burgers. The central button is used to chop the vegetables and to tenderise the meat. The twist it control is used to add the salt to the meat. The spin it was used to raise the heat when cooking the burger. 

When playing the game you have a few minutes to serve as many customers and prepare as many burgers as possible. Each order is randomly generated from the preset available ingredients, meaning some of the orders make no sense, but hey we dont judge what you want as your burger. 

Your score is calculated based on how many orders you get right vs how many orders you get wrong.

# Possible improvements
- add more feedback to the player when they perform actions
- make the controls and GUI clearer to the player
- rework the menus and endgame screen to be easier to use
- rework the gameplay to make it more interesting, make it more quick time event based like bop it is by design
- have more of a consequence to getting an action wrong
